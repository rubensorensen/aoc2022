# Advent of Code 2022

## Note
I have decided to use [aoc2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) as an opportunity to try [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). The goal is not to implement optimal solutions, nor is it to write proper Rust code. Instead I specifically aim to simply experiment with the language.

## Quick start
```console
$ cargo run
```
